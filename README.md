# Absence Approval Workflow System

This project was developed for **Al-Baha University** as a robust web-based system designed to enhance how university students manage absence reporting and monitor their academic attendance status.

## Project Overview
The University Student Absence Management System streamlines the submission of absence reports while providing students with continuous visibility into their attendance records. Through secure personal accounts, students can upload absence documentation and track their remaining allowed absences in real time.

To support academic success, the system proactively notifies students when their absences approach or exceed the permitted limit. These timely alerts help students take corrective action early, reducing the risk of academic warnings or disqualification from sitting for course examinations due to excessive absences.

## Key Objectives
- Simplify and digitize the student absence reporting process  
- Accurately track attendance and absence limits  
- Alert students before reaching critical absence thresholds  
- Reduce the likelihood of students being barred from exams due to attendance violations  
- Promote student accountability and academic awareness
